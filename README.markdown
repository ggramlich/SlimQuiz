The SlimQuiz
============

This is the base for a multiple choice quiz that helps you learn 
[FitNesse](http://www.fitnesse.org)
and
[Slim](http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.SliM)
while using FitNesse and Slim.

Take a look at [my screencast](http://vimeo.com/ggramlich/slimquiz-introduction)
introduction to the SlimQuiz. (Sorry for the missing mouse pointer.)
The screencast shows you how to start fitnesse with the SlimQuiz Wiki,
how to answer questions and how to add your own questions.

Fork the project, add your own questions or
[email them to me](mailto:gramlich@eosc.de) so that I can add them.
I really appreciate it.
